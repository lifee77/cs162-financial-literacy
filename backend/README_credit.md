## Visualizing Your Credits

### How Many Posts or Internships Can You Access?

With your initial `100` credits:

- **Accessing Posts, Scholarships, or Internships**:
  - **Cost per Access**: `0.5` credits
  - **Number of Items You Can Access**:
    ```
    Total Items = Total Credits / Cost per Access
                = 100 / 0.5
                = 200 items
    ```
  - **You can access up to 200 posts, scholarships, or internships before needing to earn more credits.**

### What is the Value of Your Contributions?

- **Posting Content**:
  - **Credits Earned per Post**: `3` credits
  - **Equivalent Number of Accesses Earned**:
    ```
    Accesses Earned = Credits Earned per Post / Cost per Access
                    = 3 / 0.5
                    = 6 accesses
    ```
  - **By posting one item, you earn enough credits to access 6 more items.**

- **Mentoring Others**:
  - **Credits Earned per Session**: `10` credits
  - **Equivalent Number of Accesses Earned**:
    ```
    Accesses Earned = Credits Earned per Session / Cost per Access
                    = 10 / 0.5
                    = 20 accesses
    ```
  - **By mentoring once, you earn enough credits to access 20 more items or book another mentorship session.**

## Examples

### Example 1: Accessing Content

- **Action**: You access 10 posts.
- **Cost**: `0.5` credits per post × 10 posts = `5` credits
- **Credits Remaining**:
  ```
  Starting Credits = 100
  Credits Spent = 5
  Remaining Credits = 100 - 5 = 95
  ```
- **You have `95` credits left after accessing 10 posts.**

### Example 2: Posting Content

- **Action**: You post 2 internships.
- **Reward**: `3` credits per post × 2 posts = `6` credits
- **Credits After Posting**:
  ```
  Starting Credits = 95
  Credits Earned = 6
  New Balance = 95 + 6 = 101
  ```
- **You now have `101` credits.**

### Example 3: Booking and Conducting a Mentorship Session

- **Booking a Session**:
  - **Action**: You book a mentorship session.
  - **Cost**: `10` credits
  - **Credits Remaining**:
    ```
    Starting Credits = 101
    Credits Spent = 10
    Remaining Credits = 101 - 10 = 91
    ```
- **Completing a Session as a Mentor**:
  - **Action**: You mentor someone.
  - **Reward**: `10` credits
  - **Credits After Mentoring**:
    ```
    Starting Credits = 91
    Credits Earned = 10
    New Balance = 91 + 10 = 101
    ```
- **You have replenished your credits back to `101` by mentoring.**

### Example 4: Active Engagement

- **Scenario**: Over a week, you:
  - Access 20 posts (`0.5` credits × 20 = `10` credits spent)
  - Post 5 scholarships (`3` credits × 5 = `15` credits earned)
  - Book 1 mentorship session (`10` credits spent)
  - Mentor 2 users (`10` credits × 2 = `20` credits earned)
- **Net Credits**:
  ```
  Starting Credits = 100
  Total Credits Earned = 15 (posting) + 20 (mentoring) = 35
  Total Credits Spent = 10 (accessing posts) + 10 (booking mentorship) = 20
  Net Credits = Starting Credits + Credits Earned - Credits Spent
              = 100 + 35 - 20 = 115
  ```
- **You have increased your credits to `115` through active participation.**

## Managing Your Credits

- **Viewing Your Balance**: Check your current credit balance in your user dashboard at any time.
- **Earning More Credits**: Keep contributing by posting content and offering mentorship.
- **Monitoring Transactions**: Access a detailed log of your credit transactions to track your activity.
- **Handling Insufficient Credits**:
  - If you lack sufficient credits for an action:
    - **Option 1**: Engage more by contributing content or mentoring to earn credits.
    - **Option 2**: Prioritize actions that require fewer credits.
